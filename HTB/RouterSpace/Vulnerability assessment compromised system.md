# Vulnerability assessment compromised system

Enumerate the system for possible PE vectors.

Knowing that the outgoing connections don't work I used the `scp` (secure copy) command with my SSH private key to transfer the `linpeas.sh` enumeration script.

```shell
scp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa linpeas.sh paul@10.10.11.148:/home/paul/linpeas.sh

```

Then run the script on the target machine.

## Privilege escalation vector

First thing I took a loot at was if the `sudo` version was vulnerable.

I looked for vulnerabilities on version `1.8.31` and I found it was vulnerable with [CVE-2021-3156](https://medium.com/mii-cybersec/privilege-escalation-cve-2021-3156-new-sudo-vulnerability-4f9e84a9f435) and an exploit [here](https://github.com/blasty/CVE-2021-3156)

The script exploit suggester also pointed this way.
