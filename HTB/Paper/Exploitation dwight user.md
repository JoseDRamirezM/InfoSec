Following linpeas output I found an exploit [here](https://github.com/secnigma/CVE-2021-3560-Polkit-Privilege-Esclation), let's try it. Transfer the exploit to the machine, make it executable and run it.

The exploit succeeds but I got to run it many times to complete the last step

The `su - jose` command failed a lot of times until it worked and then I ran `sudo bash` and I got a root shell!
