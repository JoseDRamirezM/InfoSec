# Use of software with known vulnerabilities

- Scenario 1
	## Description
	
	A vulnerable version of WordPress is used (WordPress <= 5.2.3) which induces [CVE-2019-17671](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-17671). An unauthenticated attacker can read secret content of the blog posts/drafts. This allowed to discover the `chat.office.paper` domain and an invitation link which granted access to a local **Rocket.chat** instance.
	
	## Impacts
	
	- Expose secret information.
	- Expand the attack surface.
	
	## Mitigation
	
	Upgrade to WordPress 5.2.4.

- Scenario 2
	## Description
	
	The `polkit` system utility allows a local privilege escalation vector.
	
	## Impacts
	
	- Escalate privileges to the root user.
	- Expand the attack surface.
	
	## Mitigation
	
	Update Linux distribution knowing that every distribution with polkit version 0.113 (or later) installed is vulnerable.
