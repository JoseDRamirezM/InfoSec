I created a new account to see what happens.

The registration process succeed and an interface appeared.

This is a discord-ish chat app. Let's explore it and look for attack vectors.

The "general" chat room contains a `The Office` themed conversation and the relevant part was that there is chat bot enables that performs tasks on the system.

Let's explore the bot and probably find a vulnerability.

# Chat bot
The interesting functionalities are as follows:

![[bot_system_tasks.png]]

It's not possible to write messages on the given channel so create a new one and test the bot.

**Be sure to add the bot to the channel, otherwise commands will not work**

Now run `recyclops list` 

![[chat_list_dir.png]]

Read the contents.

Let's try to access system folders by going back as follows:

`recyclops list sale/../../../../`

The result:

![[chat_bot_system_dir.png]]

Test if reading system files is also possible.

So the bot induces a [PATH TRAVERSAL](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal) vulnerability. Search for a way to get a foothold with this.
