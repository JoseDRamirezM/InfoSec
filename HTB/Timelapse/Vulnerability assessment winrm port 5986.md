# Vulnerability assessment winrm port 5986

## Winrm
In order to use the extracted information, I looked for a way to exploit the `winrm` service and came across [this](https://notes.offsec-journey.com/enumeration/winrm) article that explained a possible way to get a foothold.

Also [this](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/5985-5986-pentesting-winrm) article explained more about the service.

Following the first article I downloaded [this](https://github.com/Alamot/code-snippets/blob/master/winrm/winrm_shell.rb) script and modified it as follows:

Then run

```shell
gem install winrm
```

Finally run

```shell
ruby winrm_shell.rb
```

And now I'm able to execute commands.
