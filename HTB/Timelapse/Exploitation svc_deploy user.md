# Exploitation svc_deploy user

Given the PowerShell session of the user `svc_deploy` I got to find a way to escalate privileges.

# AD LAPS administrator credentials

I came across [this](https://adsecurity.org/?p=3164) article that allowed me to dump the administrator credentials running the following command on PowerShell:

```PowerShell
get-adcomputer -filter {ms-mcs-admpwdexpirationtime -like '*'} -prop 'ms-mcs-admpwd','ms-mcs-admpwdexpirationtime'
```

Next I did the same as before, edit the script to run with the administrator username and the obtained password.
