# Vulnerability assessment server machine

Enumerate the Linux server looking for ways to escalate privileges.

The Linux system enumeration didn't lead to privilege escalation. So I tried enumerating the resources available and related to the web application.

From the beginning it is stated that the application is made in spring boot hence it's source code has to be Java. I looked for files with this extension.

I seems like the source code.

Taking a look at the `credit_score` functionality the code takes the information written in a log file which adds to the view count of either author.

The log contains the URI to the image that the user clicked and then save that information.

Also the images have metadata that later tells the code that it correspond to X artist.

Following this idea, it is possible to exploit this code by placing the right path into the metadata of a crafted image to point to an attacker controlled XML file which ultimately will in this case retrieve privileged system files.
