# Vulnerability assessment port 8080

## Port 8080

Apply web service methodology

### Web server fingerprinting

![[web-fingerprint.png]]

From here the technology is exposed, which is Spring Boot.

## Directories and file enumeration

![[dirs.png]]

Nothing much is found, but the attack surface is now greater.

## Web app testing

### Search bar

At first I didn't get any result, but the search parameter is reflected in the page.

![[search_1.png]]

The following request is issued

![[search_req.png]]

I tested for SQLi and reflected XSS on the request parameter but those didn't work.

After wandering for a while, I came across [this](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssti-server-side-template-injection#detect) article and tried a few payloads.

```
{{7*7}}

${7*7}

<%= 7*7 %>

${{7*7}}

#{7*7} < this one WORKED!!
```

One of them was reflected in the page.

I confirmed the app is vulnerable to SSTI

Proceed to exploitation
