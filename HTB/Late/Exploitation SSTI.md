# Exploitation SSTI

After looking around I was able to find a payload to extract information in this case the `id_rsa` of the user `svc_acc` that was presented in the error message.

Now create a file with the key, assign the appropriate access mode and log in via ssh.

Capture the user flag that is in the `svc_acc` directory.
