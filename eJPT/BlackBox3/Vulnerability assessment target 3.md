# Vulnerability assessment target 3

# Port 22 SSH
Check `exploitdb` for known vulnerabilities.

Use the exploit on the target.

I couldn't use the exploit because there was missing dependencies and the provided box doesn't have internet access.

Then I found an user enumeration module on Metasploit

# Port 8080

From the Nmap scan it's known that the server is Apache-Coyote/1.1 

## Web server fingerprinting

Use the `whatweb` tool to fingerprint the server.

I ran Nikto and found the following:

![[target3_apache_manager_credentials.png]]

The credentials for the Manager aplication of the server.

# Directories and file enumeration

Let's enter the `/manager` URI and try the credentials found with Nikto `tomcat:s3cret`.

# Tomcat Manager app

![[target3_manager_login.png]]

![[target3_manager_success.png]]

It worked. Then I search for possible attack vectors given access to the Manager application.
