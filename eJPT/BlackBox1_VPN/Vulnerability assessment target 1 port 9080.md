# Vulnerability assessment target 1 port 9080

Enumerating the server I found the same results as on port 8080 even the manager application with the default credentials `tomcat:s3cret`.

To see the exploitation method read.

[[Vulnerability assessment target 1 port 8080]] and [[Exploitation target 1 port 8080]]

I tried to exploit it again to see if I get a reverse shell as other user.

But a shell with the same user `tomcat8` spawns. I guess is another way to exploit this machine.
