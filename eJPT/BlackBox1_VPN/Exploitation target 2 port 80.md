# Exploitation target 2 port 80

Given access to the `/project/` directory I enumerated it.

It seems like a blog page. Let's test it's functionalities for common vulnerabilities.

This is just a template no there's no real functionality even on user inputs. But now I can enumerate the directories and files adding the header with the credentials but first let's see how the application manages this authentication.

The `Authorization` header manages the authentication and the `YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=` string if it is base64 decoded:

So now add the `Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=` header to have access to resources.

I ran dirsearch with the header targeting the `/project/` directory.

The `/project/backup/` directory is found let's explore the content.

It seems like it's the same but let's try to run dirsearch again but in the `/project/backup` directory.

I went to `http://172.16.64.140/project/backup/test` and found the following.

Let's check what's on those files.

Skipping to the useful information here's what I found.

- On `http://172.16.64.140/project/backup/test/sdadas.txt`
	- ![[target2_port80_mysql_auth_flag.png]]
	- Here's a connection string to a MySQL server (MSSQL) and what seems like the path to the flag on the server.
- On `http://172.16.64.140/project/backup/test/test1.txt` 
	- [This link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1134319/difference-between-a-user-and-a-login-in-sql-server) That may come in handy later.

Let's check if the flag is actually on that path.

Done.
