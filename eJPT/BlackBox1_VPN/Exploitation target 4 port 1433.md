# Exploitation target 4 port 1433

## Metasploit exploitation

I looked for an appropriate exploit for the scenario.

![[target4_msf_module.png]]

Get information from the module.

![[target4_msf_module_info.png]]

This may work, configure it and let's see...

![[target4_msf_module_config.png]]

Run the exploit.


![[target4_reverse_shell.png]]

It worked! As mentioned on the information the exploit uses a local FTP server to send the payload necessary to spawn the Meterpreter.  Also the shell runs with all the privileges

Now search for the flag on the Meterpreter.

![[target4_flag_location.png]]


Navigate to the folder and read the flag.

![[target4_flag.png]]

Target 4 is done. But let's enumerate the machine to try to get more information.

## Public ssh key

On the same folder where the flag was, the file `id_rsa.pub` was present. This file is the public key of the SSH key pair from this file I knew that at least I could get a username. I read the file.

![[target4_ssh_creds_4_target3.png]]

The key contains a 'commented out' section at the end. Where's a connection URI to the ssh server on `172.16.64.182:22` which is precisely target 3 [[Scanning 172.16.64.182 (target 3)]]. The credentials can be seen directly.
