# Exploitation target 1 port 8080

I used Metasploit's `exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload` module for this scenario.

Use a Meterpreter reverse shell payload and run the exploit.

A session is created.

A reverse shell as user `tomcat8`  is obtained.

# Compromised tomcat8 user enumeration

## Network interfaces
First enumerate the network interfaces.

No other network is attached.

## System users

The current shell user could read all the system users folders. On the `adminels` folder I found the target flag.

The `developer` user folder also had a flag.

![[target1_all_flags.png]]

No more flags on this machine.
