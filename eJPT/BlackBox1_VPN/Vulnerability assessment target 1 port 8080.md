# Vulnerability assessment target 1 port 8080

There's an Apache server running. Inspect the server content.

I encounter an Apache2 Ubuntu default page. Now I now target 1 runs Linux.

# Web testing

Same information as from the Nmap scan.

## Directories and files enumeration

Using `dirsearch` and the `common.txt` word list to enumerate the resources.

Explore the found paths.

### host-manager

When I went to `http://172.16.64.101:8080/host-manager`

![[target1_port8080_host_manager_1.png]]

I was prompted with a login I hit cancel and a page appeared.

![[target1_port8080_host_manager_default_creds.png]]

I tried the default credentials on the login prompt.

![[target1_port8080_host_manager_default_creds_fail.png]]

But that didn't work.

### /manager/

When I went to `http://172.16.64.101:8080/manager`

The same login prompt from the `host-managet` appeared, again I tried the default credentials `tomcat:s3cret` and they worked. I got access to the `Tomcat Web Application Manager`.

Looking for ways to exploit this I found an article [here](https://www.hackingarticles.in/multiple-ways-to-exploit-tomcat-manager/) that explained how to get a reverse shell via various methods. 

Now that a promising Attack Vector arose attempt to exploit it.
