# Port 8000

### Web server vulnerabilities

## Git folder

From the nmap scan the `192.196.104.3:8000/.git/config` is exposed and when i navigated to it it had credentials

Now I got to figure out where I can use this credentials.

## Werkzeug service


After looking around a bit and enumerating the web server I found the vulnerable path of the `Werkzeug` exploit, let's try again

![[vulnerable_path.png]]

The exploit kept on failing so I navigated to the path

![[exploit_fail_reason.png]]

An found that the console had a pin that's why it wasn't working. I used Burp Suite to get more information.

![[burp_secret.png]]

The server response gives a secret string, let's try that as a PIN.

It failed and after looking around I noticed I've missed the service on port 5000.

Also there's a way to bypass the pin but that requires a previous LFI vulnerability on the server for more information check [this](https://github.com/wdahlenburg/werkzeug-debug-console-bypass)

Remember the [[#Git folder]]  exposed folder on [[Port 8000]] ? I tried to enumerate the folder and found the `index` file

![[git_folder_recon.png]]

And went to the index path and downloaded a file

![[git_index.png]]

And found the repo files

So as there's a LFI vulnerability because server files can be downloaded, get the repo files.

## Code analysis

### API.py

![[api.png]]

Check the code for vulnerabilities specially when taking the user input data to get a result

I found the code uses a dangerous function but performs the proper validations to the input to avoid RCE

![[api_eval.png]]

![[api_validations.png]]

If the source code could be changed somehow the validations could be bypassed, allowing to execute commands on the target.

From the config file found on [[#Git folder]] there was also a git remote source and we got credentials for the repo, so let's try to pull the repo and change the code.

![[repo_link.png]]

I tried to pull the repo using the following command
```bash
git pull http://online-calc.com/projects/online-calc
```  

But it failed ![[git_fail.png]]

So following the error message I created a folder and initialized a repo.

![[pull_success.png]]

And the pull succeeds

[[Exploitation target 1]]
