### SSRF attacks against the server itself

In an SSRF attack against the server itself, the attacker induces the application to make an HTTP request back to the server that is hosting the application, via its loopback network interface. This will typically involve supplying a URL with a hostname like `127.0.0.1` (a reserved IP address that points to the loopback adapter) or `localhost` (a commonly used name for the same adapter).

#### Example scenario

For example, consider a shopping application that lets the user view whether an item is in stock in a particular store. To provide the stock information, the application must query various back-end REST APIs, dependent on the product and store in question. The function is implemented by passing the URL to the relevant back-end API endpoint via a front-end HTTP request. So when a user views the stock status for an item, their browser makes a request like this:

``` HTTP
POST /product/stock HTTP/1.0 
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded 
Content-Length: 118

stockApi=http://stock.weliketoshop.net:8080/product/stock/check%3FproductId%3D6%26storeId%3D1
```

This causes the server to make a request to the specified URL, retrieve the stock status, and return this to the user.

In this situation, an attacker can modify the request to specify a URL local to the server itself. For example:

```HTTP
POST /product/stock HTTP/1.0 
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded 
Content-Length: 118 

stockApi=http://localhost/admin
```

Here, the server will fetch the contents of the `/admin` URL and return it to the user.

Now of course, the attacker could just visit the `/admin` URL directly. But the administrative functionality is ordinarily accessible only to suitable authenticated users. So an attacker who simply visits the URL directly won't see anything of interest. However, when the request to the `/admin` URL comes from the local machine itself, the normal [access controls](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control) are bypassed. The application grants full access to the administrative functionality, because the request appears to originate from a trusted location.

Due to trust relationships in internal systems, this vulnerability can be critical as it may grant access to administrative functionalities without any authentication.

### SSRF attacks against other back-end systems

Vulnerable applications may also be able to interact with other backend systems that users cannot reach from the outside. Such systems lie in private non-routable IP addresses. As these services are protected by network topology, they often have a weaker security posture, allowing access to sensitive functionality without authentication.

In the preceding example, suppose there is an administrative interface at the back-end URL `https://192.168.0.68/admin`. Here, an attacker can exploit the SSRF vulnerability to access the administrative interface by submitting the following request:

```HTTP
POST /product/stock HTTP/1.0 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 118 stockApi=http://192.168.0.68/admin
```
