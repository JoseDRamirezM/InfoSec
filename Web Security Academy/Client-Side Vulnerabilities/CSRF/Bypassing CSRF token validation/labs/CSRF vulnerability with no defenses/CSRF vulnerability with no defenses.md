ab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF.

To solve the lab, craft some HTML that uses a [CSRF attack](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf) to change the viewer's email address and upload it to your exploit server.

Enter the lab, intercept the email change request and then generate a CSRF PoC with Burp's engagement tools:

Store the HTML code in the exploit server and deliver it to the victim.
