The traditional way to prove that you've found a [cross-site scripting](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting) vulnerability is to create a popup using the `alert()` function. This isn't because [XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting) has anything to do with popups; it's simply a way to prove that you can execute arbitrary JavaScript on a given domain. You might notice some people using `alert(document.domain)`. This is a way of making it explicit which domain the JavaScript is executing on.

Sometimes you'll want to go further and prove that an XSS vulnerability is a real threat by providing a full exploit. In this section, we'll explore three of the most popular and powerful ways to exploit an XSS vulnerability.

## Exploiting cross-site scripting to steal cookies

Stealing cookies is a traditional way to exploit XSS. Most web applications use cookies for session handling. You can exploit cross-site scripting vulnerabilities to send the victim's cookies to your own domain, then manually inject the cookies into the browser and impersonate the victim.

In practice, this approach has some significant limitations:

- The victim might not be logged in.
- Many applications hide their cookies from JavaScript using the `HttpOnly` flag.
- Sessions might be locked to additional factors like the user's IP address.
- The session might time out before you're able to hijack it.

## Exploiting cross-site scripting to capture passwords

These days, many users have password managers that auto-fill their passwords. You can take advantage of this by creating a password input, reading out the auto-filled password, and sending it to your own domain. This technique avoids most of the problems associated with stealing cookies, and can even gain access to every other account where the victim has reused the same password.

The primary disadvantage of this technique is that it only works on users who have a password manager that performs password auto-fill. (Of course, if a user doesn't have a password saved you can still attempt to obtain their password through an on-site phishing attack, but it's not quite the same.)
