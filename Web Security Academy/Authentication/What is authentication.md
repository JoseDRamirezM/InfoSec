# What is authentication
#AUTHENTICATION 
#FACTORS

The process of verifying the identity of a given user or client. In simple words making sure that they are really who they claim to be. As websites are exposed to the internet, robust authentication mechanisms are key for effective web security.

## Authentication factors

There are three factors in which authentication can be categorized:

- Something you `know` such as a **password** or the answer to a **security question**. AKA `knowledge factors`.
- Something you `have` such as a physical object or a security token. AKA `posession factors`.
- Something you `are` or do such as biometrics or patterns of behavior. AKA `inherece factors`.

Authentication mechanisms rely on a range of technologies to verify one or more of these factors.
