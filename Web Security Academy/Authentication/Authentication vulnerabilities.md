# Authentication vulnerabilities

#AUTHENTICATION

Authentication vulnerabilities are conceptually the simplest issues. However they can be the most critical as the strong relationship between `authentication` and `security`. Bypassing authentication may allow an attacker to have direct access to sensitive data and functionality and expand the attack surface to further exploitation. That's why learning to exploit authentication vulnerabilities and how to bypass common protection measures is a fundamental skill.

The most common authentication mechanisms used in websites have potential, inherent and  implementation-related vulnerabilities.
