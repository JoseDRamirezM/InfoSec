# Recon

Interact with the app to find the api endpoint and test for available documentation. I used the `Discover Content` functionality:

![[api-doc.png]]

When trying to change the user's email the following request was issued:

![[patch-user.png]]
# Exploitation 

It becomes quite clear what to do, given that the username is passed along the API endpoint

![[delete-carlos.png]]

But this was the test user rather than the target user, do the same but replace `wiener` with `carlos`
