To solve the lab, exploit a hidden API endpoint to buy a **Lightweight l33t Leather Jacket**. You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`.

# Recon

Interacting with the application the only API endpoint found is:

```
/api/products/{id}/price
```

# Vuln assessment

From the application scenario, it seems that the only way forward is to try and change the product price by sending either a `POST` or `PATCH` request to the same endpoint with the `price` parameter in 0.

It seems `PATCH` is the way to go.

# Exploitation

Put the `price` parameter to zero to obtain a free jacket!

After that buy the product from the frontend.
