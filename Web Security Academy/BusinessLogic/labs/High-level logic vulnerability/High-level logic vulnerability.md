## Recon

The application it's an e-commerce, the goal is to buy a "Lightweight l33t leather jacket". Which the provided user doesn't have enough funds to buy.

## Exploitation

Having in mind that the goal is to manipulate some parameter in order to be able to buy the jacket, let's explore the requests the application makes.

### Adding to the cart

This requests doesn't include the price but the quantity. I tried changing that value from `1` to `-1`.

The value is accepted by the application without triggering an error.

But that didn't work, as the order price can't be less than zero, but that's actually a hint.

Add another product in such negative or positive quantity so that the price is affordable by this user i.e is less than $100.

Then place the order.
