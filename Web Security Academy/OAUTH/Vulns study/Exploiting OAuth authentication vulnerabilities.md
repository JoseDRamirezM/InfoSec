# Exploiting  OAuth authentication vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities can arise on the client application's implementation of OAuth or in the configuration of the OAuth service.

The most common vulnerabilities in both contexts are:

- Vulnerabilities in the client application
	- [Improper implementation of the implicit grant type](https://portswigger.net/web-security/oauth#improper-implementation-of-the-implicit-grant-type) 
	- [Flawed CSRF protection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/oauth#flawed-csrf-protection)
- Vulnerabilities in the OAuth service
	- [Leaking authorization codes and access tokens](https://portswigger.net/web-security/oauth#leaking-authorization-codes-and-access-tokens) 
	- [Flawed scope validation](https://portswigger.net/web-security/oauth#flawed-scope-validation)
	- [Unverified user registration](https://portswigger.net/web-security/oauth#unverified-user-registration)

## Vulnerabilities in the OAuth client application

Client applications should use a reputable OAuth service. The problem is the client side of the implementation may be less secure.
